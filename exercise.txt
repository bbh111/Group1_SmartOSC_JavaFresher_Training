1. Using the listFiles(FileFilter) and isDirectory methods of the java.io.File class,
write a method that returns all subdirectories of a given directory. Use a
lambda expression instead of a FileFilter object. Repeat with a method
expression.

2. Using the list(FilenameFilter) method of the java.io.File class, write a method
that returns all files in a given directory with a given extension. Use a lambda
expression, not a FilenameFilter. Which variables from the enclosing scope does
it capture?

3. Given an array of File objects, sort it so that the directories come before the
files, and within each group, elements are sorted by path name. Use a lambda
expression, not a Comparator.

4. Take all file from day 3 projects that can use lambda. Replace them with lambda expressions.
How many lines did it save? Was the code easier to read? Were you able to use method references?
