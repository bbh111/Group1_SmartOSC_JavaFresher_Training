1> Implement three classes: Storage, Counter, and Printer. The Storage class should store an integer.
The Counter class should create a thread that starts counting from 0 (0, 1, 2, 3 ...) and stores
each value in the Storage class. The Printer class should create a thread that keeps reading
the value in the Storage class and printing it.
Æ°
Write a program that creates an instance of the Storage class and sets up a C2      ounter and a Printer
object to operate on it.

2> Modify the program from the previous exercise to ensure that each number is printed exactly once,
by adding suitable synchronization.

3> Which integer between 1 and 100000 has the largest number of divisors, and how many divisors
does it have? By using threads, your program will take less time to do the computation when
it is run on a multiprocessor computer. At the end of the program, output the elapsed time,
the integer that has the largest number of divisors, and the number of divisors that it has.
For this exercise, you should simply divide up the problem into parts and create one thread to do
each part.
